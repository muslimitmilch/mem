# mem

Muslimitmilch's editor modal, my first rust project ever.
Indended to become a small tui text editor.
See [pflenker's tutorial](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial) i followed.

# Todo

- more key-commands
    - deleting text
    - inserting/deleting lines
    - walk words (decide what is a word)
- more commands
    - search (implement color)
    - write to file
    - quitting as actual command
- saving document history in a vector
    - determining reasonable interval (mode change?)
